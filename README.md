## Introduction
EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis process, helping to visualize and understand the data before applying ML algorithms. This project combines multiple datasets to demonstrate how EDA and ML can be used together to enhance data insights and predictive modeling.

## Datasets
The analysis in this project is conducted using a variety of datasets sourced from different domains. These datasets include, but are not limited to:

- **500 richest people 2021.csv**: Data about the wealthiest individuals in 2021.
- **Admission_Predict.csv**: Information about university admission predictions.
- **adult_income.csv**: Data on adult income based on various factors.
- **brain_stroke.csv**: Dataset related to brain stroke incidents.
- **fetal_health.csv**: Information on fetal health conditions.
- **heart_disease_dataset.csv**: Data on heart disease occurrences and related factors.
- **lung_cancer_dataset.csv**: Data related to lung cancer cases.
- **movies.csv**: A collection of data about movies and their attributes.
- **Student_Performance.csv**: Dataset on student performance metrics.

Each dataset contributes unique insights and challenges, helping to create a comprehensive analysis.
